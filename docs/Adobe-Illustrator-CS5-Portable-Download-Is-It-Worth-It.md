## What Is Adobe Illustrator CS5 Portable?
 
Adobe Illustrator CS5 Portable is not an official product released by Adobe. It is a modified version of the software that was cracked by hackers to bypass the installation and activation process. The word "portable" means that you can run the program from a flash drive or any other removable device, without leaving any traces on your computer. However, this also means that you are using an illegal product that violates the terms and conditions of Adobe.
 
## Adobe Illustrator CS5 Portable vs CC: Which One Is Better?
 
Before you download Adobe Illustrator CS5 Portable, you should consider the pros and cons of using it versus the official Adobe Illustrator CC. Here are some of the main differences between them:
 
- **Technical support.** When you buy a licensed software, you get access to the manufacturer's technical support team, who can help you with any issues or questions you might have. With Adobe Illustrator CS5 Portable, you are on your own. If something goes wrong, you have no one to turn to for help.
- **Updates.** Developers regularly release updates that improve the performance, functionality, and security of their software. With a licensed software, you get these updates automatically and for free. With Adobe Illustrator CS5 Portable, you miss out on these updates, which means you are using an outdated and potentially vulnerable version of the software.
- **Virus infection.** One of the biggest risks of using pirated software is getting infected with malware. Hackers often insert viruses, worms, Trojans, and other malicious programs into cracked software to steal your data, damage your system, or extort money from you. Even if you have an antivirus program installed, it might not detect some of these hidden threats. Using Adobe Illustrator CS5 Portable could expose your computer and your personal information to serious harm.
- **Lags and bugs.** Another common problem with pirated software is that they often have errors, glitches, and crashes that affect their functionality and usability. Since Adobe Illustrator CS5 Portable is not an official product, it has not been tested or verified by Adobe. Therefore, it might not work properly or at all on your device. You might experience slow performance, missing features, corrupted files, or compatibility issues with other programs or devices.

## Conclusion
 
As you can see, using Adobe Illustrator CS5 Portable is not worth it. Not only are you breaking the law and risking legal consequences, but you are also compromising your computer's security and performance. Instead of downloading Adobe Illustrator CS5 Portable, we recommend that you use the official Adobe Illustrator CC, which offers more features, better quality, and greater reliability. You can get Adobe Illustrator CC as part of the Creative Cloud subscription plan for $20.99/month[^1^], which also includes 100 GB of cloud storage and access to other Adobe apps and services. Alternatively, you can try Adobe Illustrator CC for free for 7 days[^1^] and see for yourself why it is the best vector graphics software on the market.
